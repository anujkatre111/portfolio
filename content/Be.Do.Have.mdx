Once I have a certain grade then I will be smart , Once I will have a certain car than I am rich, Once I learn this then I will apply for that job , Once I will have this much amount of money than I will start my business , Once I will have this much years of experience than I will switch my job , Once I will complete my communication course I will start talking more to people , Once I will have......Once I will have......Once I will have......Once I will have......Once I will have......Once I will have...... the list goes on and on and on and on and on.

Break the Loop.

Dont follow the DO. HAVE. BE. principle. "I will do this then I wiill get that and then I will be him" , it wont make you exceptionally good at anything. The world doesnt work like that, you always have to be someone first.

There is one study that shows that kids who knew the meaning of their name acted like that in some way or another because they believed in that and started acting in accordance to that.

You are the same too , whatever you wanna become , be that first , turn your persona habits and actions around , and then start doing things that will make you achieve your goal. 

You wanna be an olympic athlete start behaving like one and consider yourself an athlete , whatever you will do after that will be done smoothly since you and your identity are in alignment to each other.

Always follow the BE. DO. HAVE. principle

Be like that person , do the necessary things required and have the outcome you want . its easier that way.

So whatever you want to catch in life become that type of fielder first .

One Method to solidify your personality around that is by eliminating anything that doesnt matches that personality, starve yourself of the other persona and feed it with the one you want.

We May think that Usain bolt became champion on a certain day , so was he not before that ? he was , most of the people who succeed in their endeavours have always aligned their goals with their identity , Usain bolt always acted like a world champion and therefore he pushed himself to the point that he turned into a champion.
